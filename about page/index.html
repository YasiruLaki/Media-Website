    <!-- About Paragraph -->


    <div class="about-text">
      <p>The Richmond College Media Unit, plays a remarkable role in almost all the functions in the college. Though it is still at a tender age, being born in the year of 2002, the victories it has obtained and the services it has rendered are remarkable. It could procreate the Only Presidential Awarded Best Announcer from the Southern Province and also from the origin it could grab many All Island & Provincial victories.</p>
      
      <p> Morning News Broadcast is the lifeblood of the College Media Unit and the broadcast is done in both Sinhala and English languages.</p>
      <p> Greatest responsibility of any function organized by/in the school, is shouldered by the announcers of the College Media Unit. It is a great pleasure to mention that Media Unit is equipped with well talented News Readers, Announcers as well as News Writers and Editors and also includes designers, photographers and technicians etc. </p>
      
      <p> The Thissa Jayawardana Memorial All Island Announcing Competition which was first held in the years of 2004 & 2008 generated some outstanding Announcers at the All Island level and continues as one of the best media based competitions in the country. From the year 2014 onwards, the victors of this intense competition were then rewarded for the talent they had shown, at the grand and luxurious awarding ceremony, EAGLE AWARDS. </p>
  
      <p>Moreover, The Rivisara Media Workshop conducted for the upliftment of the skills of young resident announcers and the announcers of neighbouring schools, is just one of the many promising projects organized by the College Media Unit. </p>
  
      <p>It is the obvious truth that the unchallengeable success of The Richmond College Media Unit is in fact the resultant of dedication, commitment and the support given by the past and the present members of it, for its upliftment.</p>
